	description = Since KSC pilots kept crashing into mountains to the West, we were asked to help. We developed an instrument to lower their altitude by shooting lasers at their peaks from orbit. That failed completely, but we discovered that the laser bounced back at different time intervals depending on the altitude, thus the High-Power Orbital Lazer Altimeter was born
