	description =  This E8c bus is an upgrade over Argo-mk2 probes. The improvements were added to specialize the bus for inner solar planet missions closer to the sun and feature additional battery and propellant capacity, as well as improved thermal resistance and structural integrity. To support optimal flyby of inner planetary bodies, a number of features were mounted on the non sun-facing side, such as the Kanopus tracker and some of the sensors
