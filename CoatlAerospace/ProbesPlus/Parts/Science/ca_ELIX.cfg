	description = Born from a failed attempt to build a detector of static charge in door knobs, ELIX, the Electrostatic and Ionization Experiment, turned out to be really good at detecting electric charges and ionized particles in planetary atmospheres. ELIX can be run in low orbit, or directly in the ionosphere.
