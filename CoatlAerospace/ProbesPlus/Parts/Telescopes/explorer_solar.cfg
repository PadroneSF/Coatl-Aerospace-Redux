	description = More advanced photovoltaic cells cover the solar panels for our Explorer telescope series. 3-in-1 arrays are built to fold very close to the hull for optimal clearance when stowed. This has the benefit of increasing the angles at which the panels receives power; should the sunlight tracking system fail
