	description =  This is the strongest, most heavily shielded probe core out there! Affectionately known as "The vault," Aegis was designed alongside our Hera probe core. Aegis is heavily shielded from radiation, interference, and 2-year olds. Its shields leave little room for fancy features, but its redundant data-storage facilities will guard that sweet science
