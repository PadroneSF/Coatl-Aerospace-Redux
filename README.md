Coatl AeroSpace Redux is a re-release of Raveloda's [Coatl Aerospace Probes Plus!](https://github.com/raveloda/Coatl-Aerospace/) with behind the scenes changes at release.  I'm starting with the existing .17 Beta as the production release.  These changes are mostly housekeeping kinds of things.  Massive credit to Raveloda and the [contributors](https://github.com/raveloda/Coatl-Aerospace/graphs/contributors) to his project!
