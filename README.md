Coatl AeroSpace Redux is a re-release of Raveloda's [Coatl Aerospace Probes Plus!](https://github.com/raveloda/Coatl-Aerospace/).  I'm starting with the existing .17 Beta as the production release.  The initial changes are mostly housekeeping kinds of things.  Massive credit to him and the team of [contributors](https://github.com/raveloda/Coatl-Aerospace/graphs/contributors) to his project!
