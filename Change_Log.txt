Coatl Aerospace Redux - Forked from raveloda/Coatl-Aerospace

May 18, 2025 - Initial Release *****************************************************************************************************

A few behind the scenes cleanups, and updating things CKAN will see this mod as compatable with 12.5. Hoping to do some upgrading of 
textures in the near(tm) future.

Not sure how much of the Known Issues are still valid. I'll be looking into them. I do know that reloading the KSP database from the 
cheat menu is prone to causing issues.

************************************************************************************************************************************

============
Known Issues:
============
- KSP may throw texture errors. This seems to be be due to my heavy use of texture swapping modules. As far as I know, texture are loading fine despite the error  
- Reloading the database from the cheat/debug menu may cause some parts and vessel using them to fail to load. I cannot figure out why. Restarting KSP is the safest way to re-load the assets
- The Huygens heatshield, aeroshell and the Surveyor SRM are better off jettisoned from the right-click menu, rather than staging it. I will continue to test and hopefully solve 

Please note that the mod is still in development and there will be constant changes and updates. If you encounter any issues, please report them on the Github page or the forums!
